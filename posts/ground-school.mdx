## Optimize your content and data for AI

Everyone wants to _do AI stuff_ right now. "Add AI to the product!" "Build an agent!" "Automate our workflow!" All that is wonderful and at Airbais we can help with all of that. But there's a side to AI integration that most companies are missing, and that is how to effectively ground your content and data for use by Large Language Models (LLMs). In our Ground School course you'll learn to help LLMs GRASP your content.

  <Card title="Grounded" horizontal icon="G">
    Grounded information insures that it's focused on human (or AI) intent. It
    should also be short and to the point.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Readable" horizontal icon="R">
    Readable content should be easy to consume both by people and by LLMs. This
    is trikier than you think!
  </Card>
  <Card title="Accurate" horizontal icon="A">
    "Garbage in, garbage out was never a more important concept than in the AI
    era. Want to make sure AI is not hallucinating? Give it accurate
    information."
