## Our first tool drop!

It's a post-SEO world, where your visibility depends not on gaming search algorithms but on helping AI truly understand what you do. Airbais can help your company optimize your online presence to get the maximum exposure in LLMs and AI chat platforms, and our tools will get you there fast.

## New tools to optimize your AI exposure.

Our new tools operate on the premise that to support great context engineering you need to understand what customers want from your organization, and your content should meet those intents. If you do that well, AI will be better able to recommend your brand and products when users express the same intents in AI tools like chat.
